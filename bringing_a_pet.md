Think twice. Ada is a full-time commitment and you’ll likely stay after class to finish writing a program or will want to hang out for happy hour or to attend a meet-up. Expect to be home just enough to eat and sleep (you’ll have more time than that, but it’s smart not to count on it). Dogs will need more attention than you might have, so consider the well-being of your pet. Cats, birds, fish, etc. will be more forgiving that you’re not home at least eight hours a day.

If you don't think your pet will be happy living with you while you're in Ada but you don't want to part with him/her, consider asking a friend or family member to take care of your pet until you're in a better position to give them the love that they deserve. Be sure to discuss expenses, though -- who will pay for the pet's food, vet bills, etc.

If you do decide to bring your pet, consider how you’re relocating to Ada. If you’re driving, make sure to pack food, water, and make regular stops for them to do their business. Also make sure to find rest stops and/or hotels that allow for pets.

If you’re flying, get ready to pay. Most airlines charge a $100 fee for bringing pets on-board. The fee may vary if the pet is with you in the cabin or stowed in cargo. You’ll also need a clean bill of health from your vet to show the airline per your destination’s requirements. __Washington state requires a health certification and current rabies shots.__ Visiting the vet isn’t cheap; check if your airlines offers a coupon for the health certification and/or visit.

Whether your pet is traveling in cabin or cargo, they’ll need a carrier that abides by the airline’s regulations. Check the airline website for specifics (e.g. hard/soft carrier, requires food/water, allowed dimensions, etc.). Check these requirements weeks before your flight! You might need to order your carrier online.

If your pet is traveling with you in cabin, consider buying them a leash. TSA will make you take your pet out of its carrier to walk through the X-ray scanner and you don’t want to chase a pet around an airport. If your pet is flying with you in cabin, don’t forget to call the airline within 24 hours of your flight to reserve your pet’s place. Only so many pets can fly in cabin and you don’t want to leave them behind if you don’t have the right carrier for cargo.

Be cautious about flying with your pet if they will be stowed in the cargo -- there are a lot of sad stories about pets not surviving the trip. NEVER give your pet any kind of calming medication (like Benadryl) prior to the trip -- the altitude will make the drug be metabolized differently. Research this heavily, and make an informed decision.

Flying or driving, consider buying a calming spray or wipes to help your pet cope with traveling. They’re likely to be frightened and scared, so bring treats and remember to check in with them often.
