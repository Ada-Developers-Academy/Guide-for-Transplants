## Public Transit

Rapidrides and Link Light Rail are _strongly recommended_ over neighborhood buses due to frequency, hours, and unlikelihood of being affected by the [Great Restructuring of 2016][restructure]. (If you're considering a long commute, rest assured that routes between cities are unlikely to be affected by the restructure.)

### [ORCA LIFT](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/)

So... you’re poor! Since it’s likely you’ll have zero income while attending Ada, it’s nice to know there are some perks with falling below the poverty line. The first of few is reduced bus & light rail fare! To apply for a reduced fare pass (the ORCA LIFT card), you’ll need to stop by one of these enrollment offices and provide proof of your eligibility and your identity.

We’ll warn you now: there are tons of locations, all with different hours. There's [one near Ada](http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/locations/downtown.aspx) that's open 8am - 5pm. If you have your paperwork ready and show up right when they open (so there's little chance of a line), you can easily be out in 10-15 minutes.

They make you prove your income, and they have [tons of different options](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/to-qualify.html) for how to do that. Read carefully and show up prepared. __If you get Apple Health before you get the ORCA LIFT pass, you won't need to prove your income again.__ You can also sign up for both of these at the same time if you'd like.

Note: If you don't have any qualifying documentation to show your income, you can submit a request for your employment history (which can be done at the enrollment office). Expect it to take about a week. You can ask the enrollment office to mail your ORCA LIFT card to your home, so you don’t have to find another time to visit during their limited hours.

Note2: If you’re applying for the free Apple Care healthcare (which you can do at some of the ORCA LIFT enrollment offices), you’ll be able to skip this step since your lack of income will be verified then.


### All the different transit names

* __Sound Transit__ is the regional transit authority, which has jurisdiction over several counties. ST buses and trains are white on top with some blue on the bottom and a little green between the two. They can be distinguished from other similarly colored buses by a wave-like pattern in the middle, where all the colors meet and make magic. Or waves.
* __Metro Transit__ has jurisdiction of King County, which includes Seattle, Shoreline, Burien, Kent, Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond. All Metro buses are yellow on the bottom. Metro neighborhood buses are dark green/blue/purple on top, depending on the model of the bus. Rapidrides are red on top. Rapidride bonus: you can pay at the bus stop & board from any door. This makes boarding & deboarding much faster & thus improves ride times. Rapidride bonus 2.0: another chance to catch magic in action-- [they are all Gryffindor themed](https://www.google.com/images?q=metro+rapidride).
* __Community Transit__ has jurisdiction over Snohomish County, which includes Lynnwood, Edmonds, Mountlake Terrace, Bothell, Marysville, and... Snohomish. CT buses are also mostly white with some blue, and CT buses can often but not always be distinguished by their double-decker ostentatiousness. If you want a view during your long commute, consider moving into CT's jurisdiction! ;)
* __Intercity Transit__ has jurisdiction over Thurston County, which is a distant land from Seattle. IT buses are mostly blue with some white and dark green. They can be distinguished from similarly colored buses by patch of dark green at the rear end of the bus and the little swoop of gray or white at the top.
* _Pierce Transit_ also exists but currently has no routes into Seattle. PT operates in Pierce County, which lives between King and Thurston counties. Enjoy the not-really-irony of it having no routes to Seattle when IT has several. This is what happens when people in your neighborhood don't vote for transit.

### Fare Enforcement

Fare enforcement operate on all routes that allow boarding from doors away from the driver. They would like you to have your transfer, ticket, or transit card out when they approach you to scan. They give out warnings the first time a person is caught without fare & will want to take a picture of your ID if you are that person. On future offenses, they __will__ write tickets. [Fare Enforcement are legally allowed to detain you if you withhold your ID.][rights] But you, future Adie, will have ORCA LIFT. Your monthly fare will be easy on your pocket at $54 a month, and they will tap your card and move on to the next customer. :)
