Bye, Bye Car. Hello Bike?
=========================

Seattle is super bike friendly (and maybe even a bit car unfriendly?) so if you haven’t ridden a bike since you were 12, you’ll totally be fine riding around here. Just don't expect it to be flat. You'll get used to the hills within a few weeks. :)

Shipping a Bike
---------------
Not as hard as it seems! The cheapest, easiest, and possibly safest option is probably to ship your bike via Amtrak, if you're lucky enough to have a station close to you. They have giant bike boxes that they sell for $15 (they'll also hold onto used bike boxes that are in good condition -- and they give them away for free! When you go to ship your bike, ask if they have any used boxes lying around. They might not, but it's worth checking), and it's easy to get your bike inside. You leave the tires on, and all you need to do is remove your pedals, and turn your handlebars so that it'll fit into the narrow box. There are youtube videos if you're not sure how to do that.

If you choose to use the normal mail, check your local bike shop for empty bike boxes (they usually give them away for free). Dismantling the bike is probably the biggest feat. Unscrew the pedals, detach the handlebars from the body (the brake lines can stay attached), detach the seat, and remove the wheels. Wrap everything with bubble wrap (e.g. the frame, handlebars, suspension forks, etc.). Stuff empty space in the box with more bubble wrap or packing paper (you want to minimize any shifting or movement) and securely tape up your box with packing tape.

You can ship your bike through USPS, FedEx, USP, or shipbikes.com (who uses FedEx). Be sure to inquire about insurance -- there are some horror stories about bikes getting destroyed in the mail!


Buying or Fixing a Bike
-----------------------
Seattle has many bike shops that sell both new and used bicycles & parts. If they don't have what you want in stock, they can probably order it for you. If you don't currently have one, you can stop in one of these shops to take a look around and inquire about the bikes that they have. And there's probably about twenty others that we haven't listed here. Seattle likes bike shops (1 every 5 blocks downtown)-- but not quite as much as it likes coffee shops (1 every .5 blocks downtown).

- **[Downtown Seattle bike shops][downtownbikes]**

- **[Recycled Cycles | U District & Frement locations][recycled]**  
  Recycled Cycles has classes, too!

- **Gregg's Cycles | Greenlake location**  
  Bike supermart. If you want to buy a new bike, you can try them all here! Super friendly staff.

- **[20/20 Cycle | 2020 E Union (Central District)][2020cycle]**
  These guys have a ton of knowledge and are really kind, and they will often do small repairs for free or cheap! Their gear can get a bit boutique in price, but they sell items for all kinds of budgets and will even make an order for you. Their tune-ups cost about $65 but you’ll have the peace of mind it’s being done by a professional. They also sell used bikes at a reasonable price.

- **[The Bikery | 845 Hiawatha Pl S (Central District)][bikery]**  
  The Bikery is a great community workshop staffed entirely by volunteers. You can get parts here. This is also one of the shops where you can go to borrow tools and do the work on your bike yourself! Volunteers are available to help guide you through the repairs. The bikery runs a (guided) self service shop, and they have mostly used bikes and parts for sale.

- **[Bike Works | 3709 S Ferdinand St (Columbia City)][bikeworks]**  
  Bike Works has a ton of community programs to help teach people of all ages how to ride and maintain bikes. They work with recycled bikes and most of their programs are available on a sliding scale, which is super awesome. This is also one of the shops where you can go to borrow tools and do the work on your bike yourself! Both volunteers and mechanics are available to help guide you through the repairs.

Bike Accessories
----------------
Helmets are enforced in Seattle, so make sure you’ve got one. If it’s suffered any trauma (even falling off the counter), you may want to consider buying a new one since any damage can cause the helmet to be ineffective.

When biking at night, it’s important to be seen. Make sure your bike is equipped with front and rear lights that can flash. Reflective strips are also a great idea, but in addition to lights – not as a replacement for them. Also consider buying a neon jacket that can be seen in the dark (reflective strips are great there, too).

If biking is your primary mode of transportation, you might want to consider racks and panniers for storage. (Panniers can be pricey, but there are some make-your-own options online. Do what sounds best to you.) Biking with a backpack is inefficient in terms of space and can get pretty sweaty on your back when you’re climbing those hills. A rack that can hold 50 lbs and panniers that hold about 25 lbs each should be sufficient to hold a week’s worth of groceries for a single person.

There are requirements for reflectors as well as helmets. You can read more about these requirements and rules [here](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikecode.htm). Section 11.44.160 is on lamps and reflectors.


Bike Boxes and Protected Double Bike Lanes
------------------------------------------
Seattle has recently implemented safety improvements to help both bikers and vehicles navigate the road (check out their abridged FAQ of Bike Smarts). You might see big green L’s at heavy intersections; these are bike boxes which are meant to give bikes priority and increase their visibility when stopped at a red light. The city of Portland filmed this totally corny, but kind of useful video on how to use them.

Seattle is now a part of the Green Lane Project, so there are a bunch of new protected double bike lanes for two-way bike traffic. Check out the Dept. of Transportation’s site to learn how to use them.

Bike lanes that are painted green are a signal for areas where bikes and cars may cross paths. Be alert when in any of  these areas.


Locking Your Bike
-----------------

There are tons of bike racks around, on the street or in parking garages, so you should never have trouble finding one.

If your wheels are quick-release, consider buying two locks: a hefty U-Lock and a thick chain lock. The U-Lock should go around your wheel, the parking rack, and the frame of your bike. The chain can go around your rear wheel and the parking rack. The chain lock isn’t necessary since rear wheels are more custom than front wheels, but it’s nice to not worry about it ever being stolen.

Don’t forget to take with you things that aren’t mounted on your bike (e.g. panniers, lights, helmet)! Bikes do get stolen in Seattle but the police are pretty good about trying to get them back to people. Be sure to write down, or even better take a picture of your bike and the serial number. Have proof so you can reclaim your bike.


How to Ride the Bus with a Bike
-------------------------------
Never fear! Loading your bike might be nerve-wracking the first time, but you’ll get the hang of it. Don’t forget to make eye contact with your bus driver before getting in front of the bus and if you need help, don’t be afraid to ask. King County has a great list of instructions and also a video tutorial.

- There's apparently a place to practice putting your bike on a bus downtown. WHAT?

Bike Know-Hows
--------------
- look at google forum for questions we asked
- Make sure your brakes are in decent condition.
  - New brake pads are cheap, and totally worth it if your brakes are wearing
    down or have gotten a bit hard with age.
  - Ask your shop about rain-friendly brakes & winter tires if you're going in
    to grab new brakes already. You'll thank yourself when you're coming down that hill on the way to class and it's pouring down rain.
- __Fenders are a must__ during the fall, winter, and spring, which are times
  of year when Seattle is likely to experience occasional heavy rain. It might
  not last all day. In fact, it'll probably only rain for half an hour, but in
  the end, the road will be very wet. Without those fenders you'll get soaked &
  muddy from the wheels pulling the water up from the road and onto you.
- __Reflectors and lights are also a must during all 365 days of the year__,
  which are the times when Seattle is likely to experience frequent cloudy
  days. Even in the summer, you're going to see a lot of morning clouds and
  fog.
    - Do you want to blend into the road with your chic derelicte gray outfit?
      No, you don't. You'll get run over. Do yourself a favor and buy a set of
      lights that blind you painfully when you test them in the shop.
    - Go for the same when you pick up that jacket or those reflectors you'll
      hang on your backpack / panniers. _If it's painful for you to look at up
      close, cars will actually be able to see you in the dark or rain._
