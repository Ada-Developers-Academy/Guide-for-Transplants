Ada Developers Academy - Guide for Transplants
==============================================

Congratulations and welcome to Ada Developers Academy! This guide was written by a few transplants of Ada Cohort 3. We thought it would have been nice to have an orientation packet to help us move from our current homes to Seattle, so here it is. First of all, this is a huge step and while it may seem scary, try not to fret. You have a lots of supporters at Ada Developers Academy and hopefully this guide will help you get started. If you'd like more personal help or to chat one on one, feel free to contact any of the people listed at the bottom of the guide. We're here to help!

##Misconceptions About Seattle
- **Rain**  
There are plenty of places that get just as much, if not more rain than Seattle (i.e. states bordering the gulf). If anything, it can be overcast a lot of the time. When it does rain, it's more of a continous drizzle. And during the summer it is quite dry and nice.
- **[Seattle Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Freeze)**  
You're moving here with 23 built-in friends!! Then you'll meet their friends, and they'll meet you – even more friends! Outside of that, like anywhere else, it depends on the person. Once you're in your internship, you'll have more free time and it'll be much easier to do activities outside of Ada (and meet new people). Generally, people in Seattle can be pretty friendly.
- Not necessarily a misconception, but something you might not expect: for being a tech town, Seattle loves adventure! Whether it be hiking, camping, kayaking, climbing… Seattle has it all and people love to be outside*. * During the summer months (hey – something to look forward to!).



##Housing
**My Lease Doesn’t Begin Until After I Arrive… Am I Homeless?**  
Nah, girl! We wouldn’t leave you stranded like that. If you find yourself in such a situation, feel free to contact any of the names listed at the bottom of the guide and we'll try to find a place for you to crash. Ada will likely have some volunteers from past cohorts who are willing to house you while you look/wait for housing. Be clear about whether you’re bringing a pet or are a smoker, since it might violate the terms of their lease. And don’t forget to thank your host before moving into your new place! 

**Seattle's 20 Day Notification**  
Apartment renters are required to notify their landlords of their departure from the apartment 20 days prior to actually vacating. This means that the apartments that show up for rent (especially the good ones) are not on the market for very long. Many times, landlords will have open houses for the vacant apartment.

**Micro-Housing**  
_Maybe Marleigh could add to this? A warning about thin walls?_
There are two companies that provide micro-housing: [Footprint](http://liveatfootprint.com/) (who allow pets) and [Apodments](http://apodment.com/) (who don't). That's really their biggest difference. The studio apartments typically come furnished with a twin bed, a mini fridge, a microwave and maybe a few pieces of furniture. Both companies offer a commons lounge with a full range stove and often times a laundry room inside the building. They're great if you're particular about where you want to live in Seattle but don't have the moolah for a studio/1 bedroom. Also, they're relatively the same and brand spanking new so there's (usually) no worries about signing a lease without seeing the place. Crockpots and stovetop burners are _highly_ recommended if you're the cooking type.

**Rent Pricing**  
[A Week of Mining Seattle's Craigslist Apartment Pricing](http://www.racketracer.com/2014/12/23/a-week-of-seattles-craigslist-apartment-pricing/) This article provides an equation to calculate how much one can expect to pay each month. Using this, you can determine the expected rental price in each neighborhood based on the number of rooms and square footage of the apartment. See below for an example calculation based on the article.

_Neighborhoods in Order from Most Expensive to Least Expensive_:
- Downtown
- Belltown
- Capitol Hill
- South Lake Union
- Ballard 
- Pioneer Square/ID
- Queen Anne 
- Madison Park/Montlake 
- University District 
- Greenlake 
- Wedgewood
- Central District
- Magnolia
- West Seattle
- Columbia City
- Greenwood/Crown Hill
- Shoreline
- Lake City

- First Hill, Fremont, Beacon Hill

**Expected Rental Price Equation**  
  SQFT = square footage in hundreds  
  BATH = # of bathrooms  
  BED = # of bedrooms

  RENT = Base Price of neighborhood ($X) + (SQFT * 69.68) + (BATH * 322) + (BED * 107)

  For example, a 500sqft. 1bdr/1bath apartment in U-District would be approx.
  $1368.40 = Base Price of U-District (591) + (5 * 69.68) + (1 * 322) + (1 * 107)

If you can't come to Seattle to see the place yourself, ask the landlord to take pictures, send you a video tour or even walk you around via Skype. If you explain your situation some are understanding and willing to accomodate. Otherwise, some current Adies may be willing to go look at a place for you.

**Housemates**  
If you don't mind living with strangers/roommmates, craigslist is where most people in Seattle post looking for housemates.  At the very least, skype with a potential housemate and have them walk around the space, but be wary of sending money before seeing the space in person. This method of house searching is really better done in person (both for your own protection and because a lot of housemates won't rent to someone they haven't met in person), but if you have a place you can crash for about a week, you should be able to find something (good places go quickly) and it can end up being a lot cheaper than solo living, but only embark on this kind of housing search if you feel comfortable-- the place you live while in Ada needs to feel safe and drama free.

##Neighborhoods

![seattle neighborhoods](seattle-neighborhood-map.jpg "Seattle Neighborhoods")

**Pioneer Square**  
The oldest neighborhood in Seattle! There are sometimes cheap studios and one bedrooms here, but more are getting renovated into expensive loft-like spaces. This is close to the football and baseball stadiums, so sometimes traffic can be bad, and if you have a car and no dedicated parking that can be a big problem. Several of the homeless shelters/missions are in this area, so there are quite a lot of homeless people around. It is just south of downtown, so walking to class is definitely doable. Also, there's no real grocery store in the neighborhood.

**International District (ID) / Chinatown**  
It is right next to Pioneer Square, and there is not a super clear line of deliniation between the two neighborhoods, so a lot of the commentary about Pioneer Square applies here. As the name implies, it is an eclectic neighborhood, and there is a lot of really delicious, fairly affordable places to eat, including a lot of chinese, vietnamese and korean restaurants. The further west (away from downtown) you go in the ID the more residential it becomes. Main grocery stores are asian markets (like Uwajimaya).

**Capitol Hill**   
Known as the most LGBT friendly neighborhood. Tons of cool shops and restaurants. Likely to be a bit obnoxious on weekend nights. Very expensive in terms of housing. Expect to pay about $2000/month for a one bedroom apartment. Hard to find parking and if your building has a parking lot or garage, expect to pay more for it. A good neighborhood for someone who likes to be right in the middle of it all. The Brooklyn of Seattle.

**South Lake Union (SLU)**  
Home of Amazon. Bro-town. Not a super pedestrian friendly area, and though more retail and restaurants are popping up, it doesn't feel like much of a neighborhood. A lot of the housing in this area is both really nice and really expensive, as Amazonians who want to live close to work have the salaries to afford some really nice places, and it is very central and close to downtown. Traffic can sometimes be a nightmare here because there are only a few arterial streets (it is sandwiched between I-5 and Highway 99) and consistent construction. A lot of the buildings do have roof decks, which can be awesome for fourth of July fireworks displays on Lake Union and New Year's fireworks from the Space Needle. Make friends with people who live here so you can hang out on their roofs and boats ;-)

**Lower Queen Anne**  
Quieter more chill area of Seattle, that's a little more pricey. Located right by Seattle Center (home of EMP Museum and the Space Needle). Parking/traffic can be rough in this area because of all the events at the Seattle center, but it is a nice central place to live and sometimes you can find studios or one bedrooms in this area in slightly older buildings which can make it more affordable.

**Belltown**  
Right next to downtown Seattle, so it's wonderfully located. Lots of restaurants, bars, shops and very walkable. Mostly flat, unlike other neighborhoods. It can get a bit rowdy, especially on weekend nights. Most of the housing in this area is in tall apartment buildings, and it is going to be one of the more expensive areas to live, though every once and a while something reasonable will come up.

**Beacon Hill**  
Some places in this neighborhood will be close to the light rail station, which makes it an easy commute into downtown (and also to the airport). It is further south than most of the neighborhoods listed here, but especially if you are close to the light rail, a house here can be cheaper and a good find. There are a couple little retail areas around the light rail with a grocery store, coffee shops, a library and a few bars and restaurants.

**Central District**  
This neighborhood is further east than Capitol Hill/First Hill/the ID, but there is more residential and sometimes cheaper housing available. It is bikeable to downtown (hills not withstanding), and is generally quieter evenings/weekends than neighborhoods with more of a night life. There are a few cute neighborhood bars and good coffee shops though, like Chucks Hop Shop CD, Neighbor Lady, Twilight Exit, Cortona Cafe etc.  

**First Hill**   
Used to also be referred to as pill hill, because there are a lot of hospitals in the area. If you are easily awoken by ambulance sirens, it may not be the best place to live. The location is very convenient as it is close to downtown and to Capitol Hill, but there is not often a ton of open housing in the area. There are a few new complexes under construction in the area but will likely be pretty pricey when they open, and there is at least one microhousing building in the neighborhood.

**Fremont**  
Fremont is the self-coined Center of the Universe, and can be a fun place to live if you can find housing-- it often is sparse and expensive. It is the location of the solstice parade (which includes a naked bike ride) and is home to many bars, restaurants, breweries and tap rooms. It is north of Queen Anne from downtown, or west of Wallingford on the north side of Lake Union. From downtown, there is a bridge that is low enough it has to open for boat traffic, so that can cause some traffic problems from time to time. It is on the Burke Gilman trail (fun bike ride) and it not too terrible of a bike commute to downtown (but again, hills, because Seattle).

**Ballard**  
Ballard is kind of new hipster central in Seattle, with new craft cocktail gastropubs and microbreweries seemingly popping up weekly. It is a pretty fun place to go out on the weekends and they have an awesome Sunday farmer's market. There is quite a bit of new construction, but it is pretty pricey given it is brand new.
Getting downtown via transit isn't impossible, but because it is further west, it can make getting to sort of inconvenient at times.  It would not be convenient to commute to an east side (aka Bellevue (Expedia/Concur) or Redmond (Microsoft)) internship or job, but if you are coming from a place where you have an hour+ commute, maybe it wouldn't be that noticeable to you.  

**University District (U-District)**  
This is where the University of Washington is located, so there are a lot of rental properties in this area. There are a lot of students in this neighborhood which can be both good and bad- kind of depends on how you feel about large numbers of 18-22 year olds. There are a lot of cheap, fast places to eat and coffee shops that are open late. It is a good place to look for sublets, but realize that your housemates may be college students and it is hard (aka stressful) to move during Ada. It has fairly accessible transit to downtown, but it is a bit further away than other neighborhoods and is a somewhat hilly bike commute. In 2016, the light rail will connect through Capitol Hill (Broadway & John) to the Montlake side of the U District. 

**West Seattle**  
People often think of West Seattle as being really far away because you have to cross a bridge to get there, but it isn't actually that far away, especially from downtown, buses run fairly frequently and late. That being said, make sure you are close to a downtown bus route on the West Seattle side. It has a great retail area, Alki beach (which is the peninsula that looks back toward downtown), great parks, a nice farmer's market, good grocery options, and more housing than cap/first hill. Some people say that people who live in West Seattle don't leave unless they have to-- it is definitely a distinctive community. There is also a water taxi to downtown from the east side of Alki, but it doesn't run that frequently or year round, so it is more of a fun adventure than a regular commuting option.



##Getting to Seattle
- **Flying**  
  - So you plan on flying here...see - [Getting Your Things to Seattle](#getting-your-things-to-seattle)
- **Driving**  
  -  Two options to get your car here:
    - _Shipping_: on average will cost ~ $1000, not to mention shipping costs for all your stuff, your plane ticket, etc. So.. honestly, why even bother?
    - _Driving_: if you can, buy what you need when you get here so you can stuff your car with bare necessities and call it a day. If that doesn't work for you, renting a small UHaul trailer is a couple hundred, depending on how much space you need.
  - **Parking**  
    If you've never lived in a big city, you may not know...having a car is VERY EXPENSIVE (especially in downtown Seattle)!! Many places have their own garages but charge upwards of $200/month for parking. If you opt to not park in the building garage, the choices outside of that are scarce and/or just as expensive. Seattle public transit is pretty good. Use it.



##Getting Your Things to Seattle
There are several ways to get your things to Seattle. These are some of the methods the transplants from Cohort 3 used:

- Ship boxes to yourself via: [USPS](https://www.usps.com/ship/welcome.htm), [UPS](http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping), [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com/us/ship), [Amtrak](http://www.amtrak.com/express-shipping)
- Shipping a bike: [shipBikes.com](http://www.shipbikes.com)
- Luggage: usually $25 for each checked bag on airlines, limit of 50lbs. per bag
- Moving companies
- Driving: pack what you can into your car

Be wary that shipping lots of boxes will cost a lot. This is one of the greatest if not the greatest expense when moving. Often times you'll find that the cost to ship heavier items such as furniture just isn't worth it. Some of the transplants planned an IKEA trip together to buy furniture in our first week in Seattle. If you plan to rent a microapartment, they will come prefurnished with certain furniture. If not, keep this in mind and plan to have the necessities with you when you arrive in Seattle.



##Things You May Need
Seattle’s weather and terrain may be different than your home’s so make sure to include the following in your luggage:

- **Rain Jacket(s)**  
  Though great brand name ones can be thrifted right here in Seattle.

- **Comfortable Shoes**  
  Get ready to climb those hills! If you plan on walking as your main means of transport, rain boots might not be a bad idea either!

- **A Bike?**  
  Maybe reconsider bringing your car. Parking is tough and can get really expensive. Plus, Seattle is relatively bike friendly. Read our [getting around](#getting-around) and [biking in Seattle](/car_to_bike.md) advice.

- **Your Passport**  
  Vancouver is _right_ there. Who knows! (Other legal documents, i.e. birth certificate, etc., could come in handy later, too.)



##Buying a Laptop

**Student discount**  
Note that if you're still in college, you have access to the student discounts. It's worth checking out how much the computers cost on campus, since they sometimes will sell the older versions and will cost a bit less. Additionally, on Apple's website, you can shop with the student discount. Be sure to compare the cost of these to the regularly-priced computers -- sometimes it'll save you money, and sometimes it won't.

**Apple discount**  
If you know someone who works at Apple, you might be able to ask them to buy the computer for you. Be careful to only ask someone if they're very close to you, and be understanding if they say no. You don't want to put anyone in an awkward situation -- some people are not comfortable with using their discounts for friends.

**Macbook Pro vs Macbook Air**  
The Air is good enough for what you need in class, but if you plan to use the computer forever, it can be nice to get the Pro. These tend to have more RAM, and let you upgrade the RAM even further, so they won't seem as slow in a couple of years. That being said, it's highly recommended to upgrade the RAM if you can afford it (again, this won't matter as much in Ada but you'll appreciate it down the road). Do what makes the most sense for your budget.

**WA Sales Tax**  
Seattle has a hefty sales tax, 9.6%, offset by the fact that it doesn't have income tax. If you live in an area with lower sales tax, consider buying your laptop BEFORE you arrive in Seattle to save a little bit of money.

**Warranties**  
These computers are pricey enough that you don't want to be out all that money if something goes wrong, and they're really expensive to fix. Check out the warranties you can buy through Apple, as well as other warranties such as [SquareTrade](http://www.squaretrade.com/). Note that some credit cards also have warranties if you buy the computer with the card -- you'll have to look into your card terms and/or call your credit card company. Be sure to ask about what is covered and what isn't.

If you decide to save a little money and not get a brand spanking new laptop, check out these refurbished machines from Apple. [Apple Refurbished](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac)



##Getting Around

**Walking**  
  Don't be afraid to walk for transportation, if you live close enough. It might be a good idea to avoid heels until you get used to the hills and your feet adjust, but lots of Adies walk to class. Google Maps gives good estimates of how long it should take you to walk -- but don't forget to reverse the directions (e.g. look at how long it takes to walk _to_ Ada, and then hit reverse to see how long it takes to walk home _from_ Ada). The hills make the different directions take different times, and Google Maps accounts for this.

**[ORCA LIFT](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/)**  
  So… you’re poor! Since it’s likely you’ll have zero income once attending Ada, it’s nice to know there are some perks with falling below the poverty line. The first of few is reduced bus fare! To apply for a reduced fare bus pass (the ORCA LIFT card), you’ll need to stop by one of these enrollment offices and provide proof of your eligibility and your identity.
  We’ll warn you now: there are tons of locations, with tons of different hours. There's [one near Ada](http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/locations/downtown.aspx) that's open 8am - 5pm. If you have your paperwork ready and show up right when they open (so there's little chance of a line), you can easily be out in 10-15 minutes.
  They make you prove your income, and they have [tons of different options](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/to-qualify.html) for how to do that. Read carefully, and show up prepared. If you get Apple Health before you get the ORCA LIFT pass, they'll have it on file and you won't need to prove your income again. You can sign up for both of these at the same time if you'd like.
  Note: If you don't have any qualifying documentation to show your income, you can submit a request for your employment history (which can be done at the enrollment office). Expect it to take about a week, but you can ask the enrollment office to mail your ORCA LIFT card to your home so you don’t have to find another time to visit during their limited hours.
  Note2: If you’re applying for the free Apple Care healthcare (which you can do at some of the ORCA LIFT enrollment offices), you’ll be able to skip this step since your lack of income will be verified then.

**Bus Apps**  
  There are a couple of apps that can tell you which buses to take to get home.
  - _OneBusAway_: Arguably the best bus app available in Seattle. Locate your bus stop on the map and this app will tell you roughly when the bus will arrive. Used in conjunction with Google maps, this is a fantastic way to know when you should expect your bus to make it's stop and how to get around.
  - _Google Maps_: Just like you would use this for driving or walking around, Google Maps will tell you which routes to take to get to your destination. Use this in conjunction with OneBusAway for optimum bus trip planning.
  - _TripPlanner_: This app exists and isn't so great. It's made by the county and should be more helpful. Stick with OneBusAway and Google Maps.

**Biking**  
  If you're new to Seattle, here's a warning: the hills are no joke. The thing about the hills is that there aren't a bunch of little hills.... it's that Seattle itself can seem like one GIANT hill. Depending on where you live, it can be a good 30 minute ride uphill the entire way. (It makes getting _to_ Ada easy, though!)
  That being said, it's not a huge deal as long as you don't have a fixed-gear bike, and as long as you shift down. Don't sprint up the hills -- take your time. And don't feel silly if you get off and walk for a particularly steep block or two -- lots of people do it. Read our [biking in seattle](/car_to_bike.md) advice.

**The Ferry**  
  We _strongly_ recommend not living far enough away that you need to take the ferry, simply because commuting takes so much time. That being said, the ferry is a smooth ride, so if you're wondering if you can work while you're on the ferry, the answer is yes.

**The Link**  
  - SOMEONE ELSE?

**Driving**  
  We recommend leaving your car at home and not needing to drive. Take a look at the driving section of [Getting to Seattle](#how-we-got-to-seattle) for more info.



##Health Care

If you're in need of healthcare coverage, once moved to Seattle you can sign up for Washington Apple Health -- Medicaid. You'll need the following information to apply:

- Your household monthly income.
- The Social Security numbers and dates of birth for each member of your household.
- Your immigration information, if that applies to you.

You can apply online OR in person. Signing up for Apple Health can be done in conjunction with getting an OrcaLift card so that you don't have to make multiple trips. Additionally, qualifying for Apple Health will automatically qualify you for the OrcaLift card (See the [Getting Around](#getting-around) section for more information on OrcaLift). The cost of Apple Health is FREE and as an unemployed student of Ada Developers Academy you should qualify. Apple Health coverage includes family doctor visits, preventative care, and prescription medication among other things. Coverage may vary depending on the plan you select when you sign up. You can read up on the individual plans and Apple Health at the links below.

- Apply: [Washington Health Plan Finder](http://www.wahealthplanfinder.org) _Note: site is often down on the weekends for maintenance_
  - Create an account to apply for Apple Health



##Bringing a Pet
*If you’re bringing a pet...*

Think twice. Ada is a full-time commitment and you’ll likely stay after class to finish writing a program or will want to hang out for happy hour or to attend a meet-up. Expect to be home just enough to eat and sleep (you’ll have more time than that, but it’s smart not to count on it). Dogs will need more attention than you might have, so consider the well-being of your pet. Cats, birds, fish, etc. will be more forgiving that you’re not home at least eight hours a day.

If you don't think your pet will be happy living with you while you're in Ada but you don't want to part with him/her, consider asking a friend or family member to take care of your pet until you're in a better position to give them the love that they deserve. Be sure to discuss expenses, though -- who will pay for the pet's food, vet bills, etc.

If you do decide to bring your pet, consider how you’re relocating to Ada. If you’re driving, make sure to pack food, water, and make regular stops for them to do their business. Also make sure to find rest stops and/or hotels that allow for pets.

If you’re flying, get ready to pay. Most airlines charge a $100 fee for bringing pets on-board. The fee may vary if the pet is with you in the cabin or stowed in cargo. You’ll also need a clean bill of health from your vet to show the airline per your destination’s requirements. Washington state requires a health certification and current rabies shots. Visiting the vet isn’t cheap; check if your airlines offers a coupon for the health certification and/or visit. Whether your pet is traveling in cabin or cargo, they’ll need a carrier that abides by the airline’s regulations. Check the airline website for specifics (e.g. hard/soft carrier, requires food/water, allowed dimensions, etc.). Check these requirements weeks before your flight! You might need to order your carrier online. If your pet is traveling with you in cabin, consider buying them a leash. TSA will make you take your pet out of its carrier to walk through the X-ray scanner and you don’t want to chase a pet around an airport. If your pet is flying with you in cabin, don’t forget to call the airline within 24 hours of your flight to reserve your pet’s place. Only so many pets can fly in cabin and you don’t want to leave them behind if you don’t have the right carrier for cargo.

Be cautious about flying with your pet if they will be stowed in the cargo -- there are a lot of sad stories about pets not surviving the trip. NEVER give your pet any kind of calming medication (like Benadryl) prior to the trip -- the altitude will make the drug be metabolized differently. Research this heavily, and make an informed decision.

Flying or driving, consider buying a calming spray or wipes to help your pet cope with traveling. They’re likely to be frightened and scared, so bring treats and remember to check in with them often.



##When You Get Here
I'm in Seattle, NOW WHAT? Get settled, girl! Consider planning an IKEA trip with your other cohort transplants to get some furniture in your new space. Explore your neighborhood and get familiar (walking around is the best way). And don’t forget to do these easy-to-forget-but-totally-necessary things:

  - **Change your mailing address!**  
    USPS will charge you $1.50 to change your mailing address online, but it’s so worth it. They’ll forward your mail from your old address for about six months and they’ll also notify those sending you mail that your address has changed to the new address. (Also don’t forget to update your bank/investment info, Netflix account, social media profiles, etc.)

  - **Register to vote!**  
    Since you changed your permanent address, you’ll have to register to vote. Don’t forget to do this! Your vote is important!!

  - **Get Internet! Cable! Utilities!**  
    If your building doesn’t handle all your utilities, make sure to set them up ASAP. You don’t want to be left without WiFi for weeks! Your building manager should have a list of companies who provide for your location. The options available in Seattle are Comcast, CenturyLink, Wave, and Condo Internet.

  - **Get a library card**  
    The Seattle Public Library is an amazing public service (the central branch is 11 stories!) with many local branches that may be in your neighborhood. All you need is proof of a local mailing address (bring in a piece of mail or a copy of your lease) and you’ll have access to all the things!

  - **Change your driver's license**  
    By law, you have 30 days to change your driver's license and register your car with WA. But let's be honest, you're going to have a lot on your plate. So unless you happen to have a really nosy neighbor, I wouldn't stress it too much. Just make sure you get it done.

  - **Car registration**  
    Just do it. When you change your driver's license.

  - **Garbage**  
    Just an FYI -- Seattle likes to be green and keep the Earth happy. Because of this, it is a legal requirement for people to both recycle and compost in addition to just regularly throwing things away. Recycling is in the blue bin and compost in the green bin. Recycling, regular trash, and compost are all picked up by the waste department.
