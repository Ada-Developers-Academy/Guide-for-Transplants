## Libraries ##

### Seattle Central Library ###
I personally found floor 10 to be the best for studying.

Pros  | Cons
------------- | -------------
Quiet  | Chilly in Winter

Lots of Desks | --
Lots of Natural Light | --

### Douglass-Truth Library (Central District) ###

Lot of nooks and quiet spots for studying.

###  ~~The Capitol Hill Library~~ ###

Not a great library for studying. It's too small and too much action in/out. The meeting rooms upstairs are good if you can reserve them but they're usually taken for larger groups.

## Cafès ##

## Capitol Hill Locations ##

### Joe Bar ###
On Broadway & Roy
They have crepes and amazing coffee (and beer), and its the cutest place ever. cons: super tiny, but tables usually open up pretty quickly  [Joe Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/joe-bar-seattle)

### Espresso Vivace ###
On Broadway
"Quiet room" if that's what you're looking for.

### Victrola ###
On 15th
Has a reservable side room, perhaps good for group study sessions

### Solstice ###
Loud, usually full but you can post here for 4+hours and no one blinks an eye

### Honor Coffee ###
Small, undiscovered, quiet and big windows

### Cafe Vita ###
Popular spot for people watching, good coffee

### Cafe Vivace ###
A famous spot in Seattle, great coffee, a closed backroom that is unofficially a "quiet space", big windows and lots of people watching

### Starbucks ###
At $2.50 has the cheapest coffee in town, everywhere else is around $3

### JuiceBox ###
Small, quiet, hard to find outlets, but a great ambiance

## Near UW ##
### Henry Art Gallery ###
Closes early, interesting crowd, and you can sneak out and check the galleries (just say you are going to the coffee shop when you walk in the Henry Art museum)

## Co-working Spaces ##
Co-working spaces often have great wifi, comfortable spaces to work in, & provide a lot of support. The downside is that they often cost something more than a library or a cafe.

### The Office (Upstairs at Ada’s Technical Books, Capitol Hill) ###

This looks like a cool place. I haven't been, but it does cost $20 per day.

### Office Nomads ###

This also looks good and has a student rate for $50 for 5 drop in days a month.
