## Libraries ##

### Seattle Central Library ###
I personally found floor 10 to be the best for studying.

### Douglass-Truth Library (Central District) ###

Lot of nooks and quiet spots for studying.

###  ~~The Capitol Hill Library~~ ###

Not a great library for studying. It's too small and too much action in/out. The meeting rooms upstairs are good if you can reserve them but they're usually taken for larger groups.

## Cafès ##

None added yet

## Co-working Spaces ##
Co-working spaces often have great wifi, comfortable spaces to work in, & provide a lot of support. The downside is that they often cost something more than a library or a cafe.

### The Office (Upstairs at Ada’s Technical Books, Capitol Hill) ###

This looks like a cool place. I haven't been, but it does cost $20 per day.

### Office Nomads ###

This also looks good and has a student rate for $50 for 5 drop in days a month.
