Guide for Transplants
=====================

Congratulations and welcome to Ada Developers Academy! This guide was written by a few transplants of Ada Cohort 3. We thought it would have been nice to have an orientation packet to help us move from our current homes to Seattle, so here it is. First of all, this is a huge step and while it may seem scary, try not to fret. You have a lots of supporters at Ada Developers Academy and hopefully this guide will help you get started. If you'd like more personal help or to chat one on one, feel free to contact any of the people listed at the bottom of the document. We're here to help!

Misconceptions About Seattle _Amira & Brandi & Kyna_
----------------------------
- The rain - there are plenty of places that get just as much, if not more rain than Seattle. (i.e. states bordering the gulf such as Texas and Louisiana). If anything, it can be overcast a lot of the time.
- Seattle freeze - you're moving here with 23 built-in friends!! Outside of that, like anywhere else, it depends on the person.


Things You Will Need _Amira & Kyna_
--------------------
Seattle’s weather and terrain may be different than your home’s so make sure to include the following in your luggage:

- **Rain Jacket(s)**  
  Though great brand name ones can be thrifted right here in Seattle.

- **Comfortable Shoes**  
  Get ready to climb those hills! Maybe once you’ve got your city feet you can wear those pretty heels again. If you plan on walking being your main means of transport, rain boots might not be a bad idea either!

- **A Bike?**  
  Maybe reconsider bringing your car. Parking is tough and can get really expensive. Plus, Seattle is relatively bike friendly.

Housing _Amira & Elia_
-------
**My Lease Doesn’t Begin Until After I Arrive… Am I Homeless?**  
Nah, girl! We wouldn’t leave you stranded like that. Ada should have a Housing Committee of volunteers from past cohorts who are willing to house you while you look/wait for housing. Be clear whether you’re bringing a pet or are a smoker, since it might violate the terms of their lease. And don’t forget to thank your host before moving into your new place!

**Seattle's 20 Day Notification**  
Apartment renters are required to notify their landlords of their departure from the apartment 20 days prior to actually vacating. This means that the apartments that show up for rent (especially the good ones) are not on the market for very long. Many times, landlords will have open houses for the vacant apartment.

**Garbage**  _Things to know once your here_
Seattle likes to be green and keep the Earth happy. Because of this, it is a legal requirement for people to both recycle and compost in addition to just regularly throwing things away. Recycling is in the blue bin and compost in the green bin. Recycling, regular trash, and compost are all picked up by the waste department.

  - [A Week of Mining Seattle's Craigslist Apartment Pricing](http://www.racketracer.com/2014/12/23/a-week-of-seattles-craigslist-apartment-pricing/)
    - Expected Rental Price equation from the article
      SQFT = square footage in hundreds  
      BATH = # of bathrooms  
      BED = # of bedrooms  

      RENT = Base Price of neighborhood ($X) + (SQFT * 69.68) + (BATH * 322) + (BED * 107)

      For example, a 500sqft. 1bdr/1bath apartment in U-District would be approx.  
      $1368.40 = Base Price of U-District (591) + (5 * 69.68) + (1 * 322) + (1 * 107)

Getting Your Things to Seattle _Anita_
------------------------------

There are several ways to get your things to Seattle. These are some of the methods the transplants from Cohort 3 used:

- Ship boxes to yourself via: USPS, UPS, FedEx, Amtrak
- Shipping a bike: [shipBikes.com](http://www.shipbikes.com)
- Luggage: usually $25 for each checked bag on airlines, limit of 50lbs. per bag
- Moving companies
- Driving: pack what you can into your car

Be wary that shipping lots of boxes will cost a lot. This is one of the greatest if not the greatest expense when moving. Often times you'll find that the cost to ship heavier items such as furniture just isn't worth it. Some of the transplants planned an IKEA trip together to buy furniture in our first week in Seattle. If you plan to rent a microapartment, they will come prefurnished with certain furniture. If not, keep this in mind and plan to have the necessities with you when you arrive in Seattle.


Neighborhoods _Elia_
-------------

![seattle neighborhoods](seattle-neighborhood-map.jpg "Seattle Neighborhoods")  

**Pioneer Square**
Very eclectic neighborhood. Lots of homeless. The oldest neighborhood in Seattle!

**International District (ID) / Chinatown**
Info about ID

**Capitol Hill**  
Known as the most LGBT friendly neighborhood. Tons of cool shops and restaurants. Likely to be a bit obnoxious on weekend nights. Very expensive in terms of housing. Expect to pay about $2000/month for a one bedroom apartment.

  - *Tacos Chukis | 219 Broadway E (Upstairs)*  _once you're here_
    Best tacos! And cheap! Totally has that delicious hole-in-the-wall vibe.


  - *Julia’s on Broadway | 300 Broadway E*  _once you're here_
    Not known for its food, but for its shows! Every Friday and Saturday Julia’s hosts Le Faux Show, a drag show of “outrageous celebrity impersonations.” Sunday brunch is taken over by a never-repeated drag show hosted by Kristie Champagne.

**South Lake Union (SLU)**  
Home of Amazon. Bro-town. Basically where the Amazon-ians go to breed. Feels like a Seattle neighborhood that was bleached years ago.

**Lower Queen Anne**  
Quieter more chill area of Seattle, that's a little more pricey. Located right by Seattle Center (home of EMP Museum and the Space Needle).

**Belltown**  
Right next to downtown Seattle, so it's wonderfully located. Lots of restaurants, bars, shops and very walkable. Mostly flat, unlike other neighborhoods. Can get a bit rowdy and some complain that's it's sketchy.

**Central District**  
Info about CD

**First Hill**  
Info about First Hill

**Fremont**  
Info about Fremont

**Ballard**  
Info about Ballard

**University District (U-District)**
Info about U-district


Getting Around _Ashley_
--------------

**ORCA LIFT**  
So… you’re poor! Since it’s likely you’ll have zero income once attending Ada, it’s nice to know there are some perks with falling below the poverty line. The first of few is reduced bus fare ($1.50 compared to the regular $2.50 and $2.75 during peak hours)! Since this is such a great perk, you know there’s a ton of bureaucracy behind it. To apply for a reduced fare bus pass (the ORCA LIFT card), you’ll need to stop by one of these enrollment offices (during their very restricted hours) and provide proof of your eligibility and your identity. We’ll warn you now: they’re very picky of how you prove your eligibility. If last year’s taxes don’t fall under the line of double poverty level ($23,540 for single household; $31,860 for two) then you’ll need to submit a request for your employment history (which can be done at the enrollment office). Expect it to take about a week, but you can ask the enrollment office to mail your ORCA LIFT card to your home so you don’t have to find another time to visit before their 5 PM closing.  

Note: If you’re applying for the free Apple Care healthcare (which you can do at some of the ORCA LIFT enrollment offices), you’ll be able to skip this step since your lack of income will be verified then.

Health Care _Anita_
-----------

If you're in need of healthcare coverage, once moved to Seattle you can sign up for Washington Apple Health -- Medicaid. You'll need the following information to apply:

- Your household monthly income.
- The Social Security numbers and dates of birth for each member of your household.
- Your immigration information, if that applies to you.

You can apply online or in person. Signing up for Apple Health can be done in conjunction with getting an OrcaLift card so that you don't have to make multiple trips. Additionally, qualifying for Apple Health will automatically qualify you for the OrcaLift card (See the 'Getting Around' section for more information on OrcaLift). The cost of Apple Health is FREE and as an unemployed student of Ada Developers Academy you should qualify. Apple Health coverage includes family doctor visits, preventative care, and prescription medication among other things. Coverage may vary depending on the plan you select when you sign up. You can read up on the individual plans and Apple Health at the links below.

- Apply: [Washington Health Plan Finder](http://www.wahealthplanfinder.org) _Note: site is often down on the weekends for maintenance_

Bringing a Pet _Amira & Ashley input_
--------------
*If you’re bringing a pet...*

Think twice. Ada is a full-time commitment and you’ll likely stay after class to finish writing a program or will want to hang out for happy hour or to attend a meet-up. Expect to be home just enough to eat and sleep (you’ll have more time than that, but it’s smart not to count on it). Dogs will need more attention than you might have, so consider the well-being of your pet. Cats, birds, fish, etc. will be more forgiving that you’re not home at least eight hours a day.

If you do decide to bring your pet, consider how you’re relocating to Ada. If you’re driving, make sure to pack food, water, and make regular stops for them to do their business. Also make sure to find rest stops and/or hotels that allow for pets.

If you’re flying, get ready to pay. Most airlines charge a $100 fee for bringing pets on-board. The fee may vary if the pet is with you in the cabin or stowed in cargo. You’ll also need a clean bill of health from your vet to show the airline per your destination’s requirements. Washington state requires a health certification and current rabies shots. Visiting the vet isn’t cheap; check if your airlines offers a coupon for the health certification and/or visit. Whether your pet is traveling in cabin or cargo, they’ll need a carrier that abides by the airline’s regulations. Check the airline website for specifics (e.g. hard/soft carrier, requires food/water, allowed dimensions, etc.). Check these requirements weeks before your flight! You might need to order your carrier online. If your pet is traveling with you in cabin, consider buying them a leash. TSA will make you take your pet out of its carrier to walk through the X-ray scanner and you don’t want to chase a pet around an airport. If your pet is flying with you in cabin, don’t forget to call the airline within 24 hours of your flight to reserve your pet’s place. Only so many pets can fly in cabin and you don’t want to leave them behind if you don’t have the right carrier for cargo.

Flying or driving, consider buying a calming spray or wipes to help your pet cope with traveling. They’re likely to be frightened and scared, so bring treats and remember to check in with them often.

How We Got to Seattle _Kyna_
---------------------
- **Flying**
  - So you plan on flying here.. see - [Getting Your Things to Seattle](#getting-your-things-to-seattle)
- **Driving**
  -  Two options to get your car here:
    - Shipping: on average will cost ~ $1000, not to mention shipping costs for all your stuff, your plane ticket, etc. So.. honestly, why even bother?
    - Driving: if you can, buy what you need when you get here so you can stuff your car with bare necessities and call it a day. If that doesn't work for you, renting a small UHaul trailer is a couple hundred, depending on how much space you need.
  - Parking: If you've never lived in a big city, you may not know.. having a car in Seattle is VERY EXPENSIVE (especially in downtown)!! Many places have their own garages but charge upwards of $200/month for parking. If you opt to not park in the building garage, the choices outside of that are scarce and/or just as expensive. Seattle public transit is pretty good. Use it.


I’M IN SEATTLE!...Now What?
---------------------------
Get settled, girl! Consider planning an IKEA trip with your other cohort transplants to get some furniture in your new space. Explore your neighborhood and get familiar (walking around is the best way). And don’t forget to do these easy-to-forget-but-damn-totally-necessary things:

  - **Change your mailing address!**  
    USPS will charge you $1.50 to change your mailing address online, but it’s so worth it. They’ll forward your mail from your old address for about six months and they’ll also notify those sending you mail that your address has changed to the new address. (Also don’t forget to update your bank/investment info, Netflix account and social media profiles.)

  - **Register to vote!**  
    Since you changed your permanent address, you’ll have to register to vote. Don’t forget to do this! Your vote is important!!

  - **Get Internet! Cable! Utilities!**  
    If your building doesn’t handle all your utilities, make sure to set them up ASAP. You don’t want to be left without WiFi for weeks! Your building manager should have a list of companies who provide for your location.
    - _Comcast? CenturyLink? Wave? Condo Internet?_

  - **Get a library card!**  
    The Seattle Public Library is an amazing public service (the central branch is 11 stories!) with many local branches that may be in your neighborhood. All you need is proof of a local mailing address (bring in a piece of mail or a copy of your lease) and you’ll have access to all the things!

  - **Change your driver's license**
    By law, you have 30 days to change your driver's license and register your car with WA. But let's be honest, you're going to have a lot on your plate. So unless you happen to have a really nosy neighbor, I wouldn't stress it too much. Just make sure you get it done.

  - **Car registration**
    Just do it. When you change your driver's license.
