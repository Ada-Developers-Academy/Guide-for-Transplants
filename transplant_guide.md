Guide for Transplants
=====================


Things You'll Need
------------------
Seattle’s weather and terrain may be different than your home’s so make sure to include the following in your luggage:

- *Rain Jacket(s)* 
  Though great brand name ones can be thrifted right here in Seattle.
- *Comfortable Shoes*
  Get ready to climb those hills! Maybe once you’ve got your city feet you can wear those pretty heels again.
- *A Bike?*
  Maybe reconsider bringing your car. Parking is tough and can get really expensive. Plus, Seattle is super bike friendly.


Housing
-------
*My Lease Doesn’t Begin Until After I Arrive… Am I Homeless?*
Nah, girl! We wouldn’t leave you stranded like that. Ada should have a Housing Committee of volunteers from past cohorts who are willing to house you while you look/wait for housing. Be clear whether you’re bringing a pet or are a smoker, since it might violate the terms of their lease. And don’t forget to thank your host before moving into your new place!

Neiborhoods
-----------
*Pioneer Square*
Lots of homeless. The oldest neighborhood in Seattle!

*Capitol Hill*
Tons of cool shops and restaurants. Likely to be a bit obnoxious on weekend nights. Very expensive in terms of housing and fun. Expect to pay about $2000/month for a one bedroom apartment.

  - Tacos Chukis | 219 Broadway E (Upstairs)
    Best tacos! And cheap! Totally has that delicious hole-in-the-wall vibe.


  - Julia’s on Broadway | 300 Broadway E
    Not known for its food, but for its shows! Every Friday and Saturday Julia’s hosts Le Faux Show, a drag show of “outrageous celebrity impersonations.” Sunday brunch is taken over by a never-repeated drag show hosted by Kristie Champagne.

*South Lake Union*
Bro-town. Basically where the Amazon-ians go to breed. Feels like a Seattle neighborhood that was bleached years ago.

Bringing a Pet
--------------
_If you’re bringing a pet…_

Think twice. Ada is a full-time commitment and you’ll likely stay after class to finish writing a program or will want to hang out for happy hour or to attend a meet-up. Expect to be home just enough to eat and sleep (you’ll have more time than that, but it’s smart not to count on it). Dogs will need more attention than you might have, so consider the well-being of your pet. Cats, birds, fish, etc. will be more forgiving that you’re not home at least eight hours a day.

If you do decide to bring your pet, consider how you’re relocating to Ada. If you’re driving, make sure to pack food, water, and make regular stops for them to do their business. Also make sure to find rest stops and/or hotels that allow for pets.

If you’re flying, get ready to pay. Most airlines charge a $100 fee for bringing pets on-board. The fee may vary if the pet is with you in the cabin or stowed in cargo. You’ll also need a clean bill of health from your vet to show the airline per your destination’s requirements. Washington state requires a health certification and current rabies shots. Visiting the vet isn’t cheap; check if your airlines offers a coupon for the health certification and/or visit. Whether your pet is traveling in cabin or cargo, they’ll need a carrier that abides by the airline’s regulations. Check the airline website for specifics (e.g. hard/soft carrier, requires food/water, allowed dimensions, etc.). Check these requirements weeks before your flight! You might need to order your carrier online. If your pet is traveling with you in cabin, consider buying them a leash. TSA will make you take your pet out of its carrier to walk through the X-ray scanner and you don’t want to chase a pet around an airport. If your pet is flying with you in cabin, don’t forget to call the airline within 24 hours of your flight to reserve your pet’s place. Only so many pets can fly in cabin and you don’t want to leave them behind if you don’t have the right carrier for cargo.

Flying or driving, consider buying a calming spray or wipes to help your pet cope with traveling. They’re likely to be frightened and scared, so bring treats and remember to check in with them often.

I’M IN SEATTLE!...Now What?
---------------------------
Get settled, girl! Consider planning an IKEA trip with your other cohort transplants to get some furniture in your new space. Explore your neighborhood and get familiar (walking around is the best way). And don’t forget to do these easy-to-forget-but-damn-totally-necessary things:

  - *Change your mailing address!*
    USPS will charge you $1.50 to change your mailing address online, but it’s so worth it. They’ll forward your mail from your old address for about six months and they’ll also send you a bunch of moving-in coupons. (Also don’t forget to update your bank info, Netflix account and social media profiles.)
  - *Register to vote!*
    Since you changed your permanent address, you’ll have to register to vote. Don’t forget to do this! Your vote is important!! 
  - *Get Internet! Cable! Utilities!*
    If your building doesn’t handle all your utilities, make sure to set them up ASAP. You don’t want to be left without WiFi for weeks! Your building manager should have a list of companies who provide for your location.
  - *Get a library card!*
    The Seattle Public Library is an amazing public service (the central branch is 11 stories!) with many local branches that may be in your neighborhood. All you need is proof of a local mailing address (bring in a piece of mail or a copy of your lease) and you’ll have access to all the things!
