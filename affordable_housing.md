## What are MFTE Apartments?
Seattle has rent controlled buildings!  Often, new buildings will reserve 20% of their units for the city's Multifamily Tax Exemption (MFTE) program.   These are brand new units that are listed at 70-50% of market value and always advertised as MFTE on Hotpads and Craigslist.

## How to find MFTE Apartments?
The city requires that property managers include the keyword 'MFTE' in their postings but these apartments tend to rent quickly enough that they are only advertised when buildings first open.

In addition to using the keyword "MFTE" during your housing search you can call down a published list of MFTE buildings to inquire about openings.  It can be hard to get a hold of leasing offices but the information you Ã§an uncover is totally worth it.

Past Adies have found it helpful to start at the bottom working up from the newest buildings.

## Qualifying for an MFTE Apartment

These are sometimes called 'Goldilocks Programs' because to qualify applicants must make above a building's minimum income and less than the maximum set by the city.

Important things to know are :
You can count gift income from friends and family towards your minimum
Students loans will count towards the minimum but not the maximum
Income qualifications are based on forward projections for the next 12 months so your salary before Ada will not affect your prospects.

I found the MFTE compliance manual online and found it really reassuring to understand the program and what's expected of applicants. I'd recommend reading it if you're unsure about anything or as a way to familiarize yourself with the program but I've tried to consolidate the forms you're likely to need in the email below.

There are a number of different forms required for Income Verification and you can find links to most of them on either in the Compliance Manual or on the city's MFTE Resource Page but I've collected links to the most important ones below.


##R equired Forms
Seattle Housing is a frantic and competitive field where leasing agents can often be overwhelmed and slow to respond. The building should give you paperwork, walk you through the process and answer your questions but sometimes that just doesn't happen. Preparing your own MFTE application will save you time and help you qualify more quickly.
